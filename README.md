# IronBook — Low-Latency Matching Engine

A single-node, low-latency stock exchange matching engine built from scratch in Java 21. Inspired by the [LMAX Disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/) architecture used by real financial exchanges to process millions of orders per second.

This is not a toy project — it implements the same core design principles that power Wall Street's fastest trading systems: a **single-threaded sequencer**, **price-time priority matching**, a **write-ahead log** for crash recovery, and a **TCP networking layer** for real client connections.

## How It Works

### 1. Order Matching — Price-Time Priority

When a new order arrives, the engine checks if it can immediately trade against an existing order on the opposite side:

| Incoming Order | Matches Against | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| **BUY** at $150 | Resting **SELL** orders | If the best (lowest) ask price ≤ $150 |
| **SELL** at $100 | Resting **BUY** orders | If the best (highest) bid price ≥ $100 |

If multiple resting orders exist at the same price, the one that arrived **first** gets filled first. This is called **time priority** — it's the same fairness rule used by NYSE and NASDAQ.

If only part of an order can be filled (e.g., you want 10 shares but only 4 are available), the order is **partially filled** and the remaining 6 shares rest in the book, waiting for a future match.

### 2. The Sequencer — Why Single-Threaded is Faster

The most counterintuitive part of this engine: **only one thread ever touches the OrderBook.** 

When 10 clients connect simultaneously, their TCP threads don't try to modify the book. Instead, each thread writes a lightweight command object and drops it into a shared queue. A single dedicated "sequencer" thread pulls from this queue and processes commands one at a time.

**Why is one thread faster than ten?**
- **Zero lock contention.** With multiple threads, every access to shared data requires locks, which block and slow everything down. With one thread, no locks are needed at all.
- **CPU cache friendliness.** One thread keeps the book's data hot in L1/L2 cache. Multiple threads cause constant cache invalidation.
- **Determinism for free.** The queue imposes a strict order. Log order = processing order = replay order. Crash recovery works automatically.

This is the exact principle behind the [LMAX Disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/), which processes 6 million orders per second on a single thread.

### 3. Crash Recovery — Write-Ahead Logging

Every order is written to a log file on disk **before** it is processed in memory. If the engine crashes:

1. On restart, `LogReplayer` reads the entire log file top-to-bottom.
2. It replays every `NEW` order and `CANCEL` event into a fresh, empty `OrderBook`.
3. Because matching is deterministic (same inputs → same outputs), the rebuilt state is **identical** to what existed before the crash.
4. The sequence counter is seeded past the highest historical value, so new orders never reuse old IDs.

No data is lost. No manual intervention required.

### 4. TCP Networking

Clients connect via raw TCP sockets and send plain-text commands:

```
NEW,BUY,150,10       →  Buy 10 shares at price 150
NEW,SELL,100,5        →  Sell 5 shares at price 100
CANCEL,O-42           →  Cancel order with ID "O-42"
```

Each client gets its own thread from a fixed pool of 10 workers. The `OrderMessageParser` validates and converts raw text into structured commands before they reach the engine.

## Data Structures & Complexity

| Operation | Data Structure | Time Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Best bid/ask lookup | `TreeMap.firstEntry()` | O(log n) |
| Add order at price level | `TreeMap.computeIfAbsent()` + `LinkedList.add()` | O(log n) |
| Cancel by orderId | `HashMap.remove()` + `LinkedList.remove()` | O(1) lookup + O(k) removal within level |
| Match incoming order | Walk `TreeMap` + drain `LinkedList` | O(m) where m = number of fills |

The `OrderBook` uses plain (non-concurrent) collections (`TreeMap`, `LinkedList`, `HashMap`) because the sequencer guarantees only one thread ever accesses them. This is faster than `ConcurrentSkipListMap`/`ConcurrentHashMap` because it avoids all internal synchronization overhead.

---

## Test Suite

**16 tests across 4 test classes**, covering unit, integration, and stress testing:

| Test Class | Tests | What It Proves |
|---|---|---|
| `OrderBookTest` | 8 | Matching logic: full fills, partial fills, price-time priority, cancellation, no-cross scenarios |
| `CrashRecoveryTest` | 4 | WAL durability: orders survive crashes, partial fills recover correctly, cancels persist, sequence numbers don't collide |
| `TCPServerTest` | 2 | End-to-end integration: real TCP socket → parser → engine → OrderBook, verified with `CountDownLatch` (zero `Thread.sleep`) |
| `ConcurrencyStressTest` | 2 | Thread safety: 10 threads × 1,000 orders = 10,000 orders processed with zero shares lost or duplicated |
| `LoadGeneratorTest` | 1 | Benchmarking integration: full end-to-end multi-client load generation over raw TCP |

Run all tests:

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest="OrderBookTest,CrashRecoveryTest,TCPServerTest,ConcurrencyStressTest,LoadGeneratorTest"
```

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **`long` for price, not `double`** | Floating-point math causes rounding errors in money. Using `long` (cents/paise) is how real exchanges avoid `0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3` bugs. |
| **Sealed interface for commands** | Java 21's `sealed interface` + `record` types give compile-time exhaustiveness checks — the `switch` in `executeCommand()` will fail to compile if a new command type is added but not handled. |
| **`CountDownLatch` for server readiness** | Tests use `server.awaitReady()` instead of `Thread.sleep()`. The latch unblocks the exact millisecond the socket is bound — no guessing, no flaky tests. |
| **Plain collections over concurrent ones** | Since the sequencer guarantees single-threaded access to the OrderBook, `TreeMap` is faster than `ConcurrentSkipListMap` (no CAS overhead). |
| **WAL flushes on every write** | `writer.flush()` after every `append()` trades throughput for durability. In a matching engine, losing a confirmed order is worse than being slightly slower. |

## Performance Benchmarks (JMH)

Micro-benchmarking was performed using JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) to measure the theoretical limit of the single-threaded matching logic and the queue contention overhead of the multi-threaded producer pipeline.

**System:** JVM 21 (HotSpot 64-Bit), single node.

### 1. Single-Threaded OrderBook (Theoretical Max)
This measures the core matching logic in complete isolation (no network, no threads, no WAL). It proves how fast the `TreeMap` based OrderBook can match or rest orders:
*   **Throughput (Lookup):** `381,634,302 ops/sec` (Best-ask lookup)
*   **Latency (Lookup):** `~2.6 nanoseconds` per operation.
*   **Theoretical Engine Capacity:** Assuming a full order match (insert + match logic) takes a conservative `~50 nanoseconds`, the single-threaded Sequencer has a theoretical ceiling of **20,000,000 (20 Million) orders per second** before hitting physical CPU limits. (We conservatively rate the core at 5 to 10 Million ops/sec to leave headroom for garbage collection).

### 2. Concurrent Pipeline (Real-world Simulation)
This measures the full producer-consumer pipeline where multiple threads (simulating TCP workers) push orders into the `LinkedBlockingQueue` concurrently, while the sequencer thread drains and processes them.

| Threads (Producers) | Throughput (Orders/sec) | Avg Latency (µs/order) |
|:---:|---:|---:|
| **1** | `314,873` | `9.0 µs` |
| **2** | `595,981` | `7.6 µs` |
| **4** | `491,850` | `55.6 µs` |
| **8** | `617,445` | `68.0 µs` |

**Observations:**
1.  **Scaling Ceiling:** The pipeline throughput peaks at around 600k ops/sec. Pushing more than 4-8 concurrent threads into the `LinkedBlockingQueue` causes latency to spike (queue contention) without increasing throughput.
2.  **Sequencer Speed:** The single consumer thread is so fast it can process 600,000 requests per second. The bottleneck is the producer's lock contention on the queue insertion, not the matching engine itself.

## Load Generator (Fake Trader Bot)

A standalone benchmarking tool that simulates multiple trading clients connecting over real TCP sockets and firing random orders at the engine.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the Spring Boot backend
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10"; ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl web

# Terminal 2: Run the load generator (5 clients × 1,000 orders at full speed)
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10"; ./mvnw compile exec:java -pl engine "-Dexec.mainClass=com.ironbook.matching_engine.LoadGen.LoadGenerator"
```

### CLI Options

```
Usage: LoadGenerator [options]

Options:
  --host <hostname>    Server host (default: localhost)
  --port <port>        Server port (default: 9999)

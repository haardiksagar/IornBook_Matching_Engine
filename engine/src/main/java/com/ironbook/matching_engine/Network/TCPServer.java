     **** A CountDownLatch (Starting Gun / Alarm Clock)****
     * A CountDownLatch does NOT stop or block incoming requests! It is simply a
     * one-time alarm clock that
     * says: "Ready, Set, GO!"
     * 
     * In our TCPServer, readyLatch is only used once when the server boots up:
     * 
     * 1. When you start the program, the server needs a few milliseconds to open
     * port 9999.
     * 
     * 2. During those first few milliseconds, the latch is at 1 (gate closed),
     * telling our tests: "Hold on,
     * don't send orders yet, I'm still booting up!"
     * 
     * 3. The exact instant port 9999 opens, the server calls
     * readyLatch.countDown(), dropping it to 0.
     * 
     * 4. The gate opens and stays open forever!
     * 
     * Once that latch hits 0, it never blocks, stops, or slows down any of the
     * thousands of client requests
     * flooding into the server!

     * the server's network port is 100% open and ready to accept client
     * connections.
     * Why we need it: Instead of guessing or sleeping for a random number of

     * to start sending orders without crashing.
     * 
     * 2. stop() (The "Closing Time" Button)
     * What it does: It safely shuts down the entire server when we are done.
     * How it cleans up in 3 steps:
     * running = false: Tells the server to stop trying to loop.
     * serverSocket.close(): Locks the main front door (port 9999), which instantly
     * stops the server from waiting for new clients.
     * clientThreadPool.shutdown(): Sends our team of 10 worker threads home so they
     * don't stay frozen in memory and cause memory leaks!

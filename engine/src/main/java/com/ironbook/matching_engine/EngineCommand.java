 * Represents a single unit of work to be processed by the sequencer
 * thread. TCP client threads NEVER touch the OrderBook directly -
 * they construct an EngineCommand and drop it into the shared queue.
 * The sequencer pulls commands one at a time, in strict FIFO order,
 * and executes them. This guarantees:
 *
 *   1) No two threads ever modify the OrderBook simultaneously.
 *   2) Log order = processing order = replay order (determinism).
 *   3) Zero lock contention on the hot path.
 *
 * Each command carries a CountDownLatch so that callers who NEED to
 * wait for completion (e.g. tests, or synchronous API endpoints)
 * can block on it. Callers who don't care (e.g. fire-and-forget TCP)
 * simply ignore the latch.

/**
 * TICKET-18: Concurrent benchmark of the FULL MatchingEngine pipeline.
 *
 * Unlike OrderBookBenchmark (TICKET-17) which tests the naked OrderBook
 * in single-threaded isolation, this benchmark tests what actually
 * happens in production:
 *
 *   Multiple threads → LinkedBlockingQueue → Sequencer → WAL → OrderBook
 *
 * This measures the REAL throughput ceiling of the system, including:
 * - Queue insertion contention (multiple producers pushing simultaneously)
 * - Sequencer bottleneck (single consumer pulling one-at-a-time)
 * - WAL disk I/O (flush on every write)
 *
 * The comparison between TICKET-17 and TICKET-18 answers the key question:
 * "How much overhead does the sequencer pattern add compared to raw matching?"

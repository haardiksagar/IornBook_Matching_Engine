/*
toString() overrides the default Java behavior of printing an object.

Without it, if you ever do System.out.println(trade), you get something useless like:

com.ironbook.matching_engine.Model.Trade@4a574795
With it, you get something human-readable:

Trade{tradeId='T-1', buyOrderId='ORD-42', sellOrderId='ORD-17', 
price=15000, quantity=10, timestamp=1721612345678}
It's purely for debugging and logging convenience. It has zero effect on 
your matching engine's logic or performance. If you don't plan on printing
trades to the console or logs, you can safely remove it.

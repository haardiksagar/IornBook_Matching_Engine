/*
 * The central orchestrator. Ties OrderBook, WriteAheadLog, and
 * LogReplayer together behind a SINGLE-THREADED SEQUENCER.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (the "LMAX Pattern"):
 * -----------------------------------
 * Multiple TCP client threads can call submitNewOrder() and
 * cancelOrder() simultaneously. But NONE of them touch the
 * OrderBook or WriteAheadLog directly. Instead, each call:
 *
 * 1) Builds a lightweight EngineCommand object
 * 2) Drops it into a shared LinkedBlockingQueue
 * 3) Returns immediately (fire-and-forget)
 *
 * A single dedicated "sequencer" thread sits in a tight loop,
 * pulling commands from the queue one at a time, in strict FIFO
 * order, and executing them:
 *
 * command = queue.take(); // blocks until something arrives
 * log(command); // WAL write
 * execute(command); // OrderBook mutation
 *
 * Because only ONE thread ever reads or writes the OrderBook,
 * there is ZERO lock contention on the hot path. No synchronization,
 * no ConcurrentHashMap, no race conditions. Order of processing
 * is identical to order of logging, which is identical to replay
 * order on crash recovery. Determinism is automatic.

    /*
     * Think of a LinkedBlockingQueue as a Thread-Safe Conveyor Belt or Inbox Tray.
     * 
     * Here is what the three words mean in simple terms:
     * 
     * 1. Queue (First-In, First-Out)
     * Like a line at a grocery store checkout. Whoever drops an order ticket into
     * the box first gets
     * their order processed first.
     * 
     * 2. Linked (Expandable)
     * It uses a flexible chain in memory, meaning the inbox can stretch and grow to
     * hold thousands
     * of orders without running out of space.
     * 
     * 3. Blocking (The Superpower!)
     * This is why we use it instead of a normal list:
     * 
     * (a). No Fighting: 10 worker threads can drop tickets into it at the exact
     * same millisecond without
     * crashing or corrupting data.
     * 
     * (b). Smart Sleep (take()): If the box is completely empty, the Sequencer
     * thread automatically
     * pauses ("blocks") and goes to sleep! The exact millisecond a worker thread
     * drops a new order
     * into the box, the queue wakes the Sequencer up. This saves CPU power because
     * the thread isn't
     * spinning in an empty loop!
